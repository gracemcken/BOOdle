Correct word | When the correct word is entered, all tiles should flip and turn green, triggering a pop up message. | As expected | Pass
Win message | Message that pops up when you guess the correct word should contain a button which when clicked should refresh the page and reset the game. | As expected | Pass
Game over message | Should the user get the wrong word in the last row, a pop up message containing a button which when clicked should refresh the page and reset the game should appear. | As expected | Pass
