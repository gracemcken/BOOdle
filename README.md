# Design
As this was going to be a Wordle clone, I wanted my project to resemble it enough that it would be recognizable, while also maintaining the uniqueness I wanted to give it. Choosing Halloween as a theme opened up many options design wise, both visually and in regards to functionality. Where a general Wordle clone might use an API to randomize words, I only wanted words relating to Halloween to appear. Below is a mind map of how I approached designing specific features.

## Wireframes
My draft idea of what the site would look like is shown in the wireframes below. During development, the project changed slightly and doesn't resemble the original plans exactly, but I believe the final product turned out good.

## Colour Scheme

When choosing the colour scheme for this project, I had a very clear idea in my mind of what I wanted. Due to the Halloween theme, I felt some oranges, browns and dark yellows suited it most. I did however have to change where I used certain colours. 

For example, I used #D05301 as the colour for the keys, with white as the font colour. To me, it seemed like a nice contrast however when I checked the site with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) I found out that the contrast was an issue. To fix this, I changed the primary colour of the keys to #FFB83C, with a border of #D05301, and used #3a3330 as the font colour. This solved that issue while maintaining the colour scheme and look I wanted.

# Testing

## Functional Testing


## Browser Testing 
- Page behaves as expected in all browsers tested. The website was tested in .


- On the mobile and tablet website was tested in



## Validator Testing

## Bugs

Bug | Status 
----|-------
Keyboard overflowed on smaller screen sizes| Resolved
Keyboard disappeared during changes for responsiveness | Resolved
Favicon would not show on live site | Resolved
Win message showing incorrectly behind tiles | Resolved
Page refreshed before button was clicked | Resolved
Keys squished too much on smaller screens | Resolved

## Known Issues
- On smaller screen sizes, the keyboard becomes slightly more squished. I attempted to fix this to the best of my ability but I feel this is still an issue.
- On some small screens there is a small amount on vertical scroll, initially it was worse and the user could not see the first row of tiles when using the keyboard but I changed the CSS to fix this. While there's still a small amount of scroll on some small screens, it now does not disrupt the game.

# Acknowledgments
- Special thanks to Bim Williams and Brynjar Nilsen for their help with responsiveness, when I thought all hope was lost they brought me back down to Earth reminding me that making things more complicated isn't always the worst thing in the world.
- To my partner James who came up with the list of words and who fed me when I got too engrossed in coding to remember to eat.
- My mentor Spencer, who suggested adding music and as always has been extremely supportive during our meetings.
