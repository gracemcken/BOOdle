# Testing

## Functional Testing

- On the mobile and tablet website was tested in



## Validator Testing

## Bugs

Bug | Status 
----|-------
Keyboard overflowed on smaller screen sizes| Resolved
Keyboard disappeared during changes for responsiveness | Resolved
Favicon would not show on live site | Resolved
Win message showing incorrectly behind tiles | Resolved

## Known Issues
- On smaller screen sizes, the keyboard loses its tradition 'keyboard shape', which it has on larger screens. I tried many different things but I don't think it's within my skill to fix it. All buttons still work perfectly and it is fully functional, however it just does not look like I would hope it would.

# Acknowledgments
- Special thanks to Bim Williams and Brynjar Nilsen for their help with responsiveness, when I thought all hope was lost they brought me back down to Earth reminding me that making things more complicated isn't always the worst thing in the world.
- To my partner James who came up with the list of words and who fed me when I got too engrossed in coding to remember to eat.
- My mentor Spencer, who suggested adding music and as always has been extremely supportive during our meetings.
